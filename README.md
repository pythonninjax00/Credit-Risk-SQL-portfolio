# Credit Risk Assessment & Early Warning System (SQL)

## Overview
This project presents a SQL driven credit risk analytics framework designed to assess Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and early warning indicators within a retail credit card portfolio.

The analysis mirrors real world credit risk practices used in retail banking and consulting, focusing on behavioural risk drivers, portfolio exposure concentration, and actionable risk mitigation strategies.

## Key Components
- Demographic Risk Profiling
- Behavioural Feature Engineering (Delinquency, Utilisation, Payment Discipline)
- Behavioural Risk Scorecard (A–D Grades)
- Exposure at Default (EAD) & Loss Concentration
- Early Warning System & Debt Spiral Detection
- Risk Mitigation & Credit Strategy Recommendations

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (Google BigQuery)
- Retail Credit Risk Analytics
- Portfolio Segmentation & Scorecard Design

## Dataset
UCI Credit Card Default Dataset(3,000 customers)
(Source: Kaggle, Taiwan (April 2005 to September 2005))

## Key Insights
- Default risk is driven primarily by behavioural deterioration rather than static demographics.
- Mid-risk segments contribute the highest absolute exposure at risk due to scale.
- High-risk segments are effectively controlled through exposure limits.
- Early warning indicators detect liquidity stress before formal default.
